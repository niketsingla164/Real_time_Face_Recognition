Real-Time Face Recognition Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Overview
This project implements a real-time face recognition system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The system is capable of detecting and recognizing faces from a live video feed or webcam input. The project leverages computer vision techniques to identify and classify faces based on a pre-trained dataset.

Features
Real-Time Face Detection: The system detects faces in real-time using a webcam or video feed.
Face Recognition: Identifies and classifies detected faces based on a dataset of labeled images.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm: Utilizes the KNN algorithm for classifying faces, providing a simple yet effective method for recognition.
Dataset Creation: Capture and label images to build a custom dataset for training the recognition model.
Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-face-recognition-knn.git
cd real-time-face-recognition-knn
Dataset Preparation
Before running the face recognition system, you need to prepare a dataset of faces:

Collect Images: Capture images of the individuals you want to recognize using a webcam or camera. Save these images in separate folders, each named after the person (e.g., person_1, person_2, etc.).

Preprocessing: The images will be preprocessed by the system, including resizing and converting to grayscale.

Labeling: The folders' names will be used as labels for training the KNN model.

How to Run
Train the KNN Model:

Run the script to train the KNN model on your dataset:

bash
Copy code
python train_knn.py
This script will preprocess the images, extract features, and train the KNN classifier.

Start Real-Time Face Recognition:

Use the following command to start the real-time face recognition system:

bash
Copy code
python recognize_faces.py
The system will open a webcam feed and start recognizing faces in real-time.

How It Works
Face Detection: The system uses OpenCV's pre-trained Haar cascades to detect faces in each frame of the video feed.

Feature Extraction: Each detected face is preprocessed and converted into a feature vector.

KNN Classification: The KNN algorithm compares the feature vector against the dataset to classify the face.

Real-Time Output: The recognized person's name is displayed on the video feed.

Future Enhancements
Expand Dataset: Include more people and variations in lighting conditions, angles, and expressions.
Performance Optimization: Improve the speed and accuracy of face detection and recognition.
Model Improvement: Experiment with other algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for better performance.
