# Real_Time_Face_Recognition_Using_KNN_Algorithm
This project implements a real-time face recognition system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The system is capable of detecting and recognizing faces from a live video feed or webcam input. The project leverages computer vision techniques to identify and classify faces based on a pre-trained dataset. ( ACCURACY - 91.5 % )
